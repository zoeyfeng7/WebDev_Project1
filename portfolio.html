        <h2>Project 1: Web Development Internship</h2>
        <p>
          During my internship at ABC company, I contributed to the development
          of a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          React. This project aimed to improve user engagement through an
          intuitive user interface and was praised for its clean design and
          seamless functionality.

        <h2>Project 2: Software Engineering Internship</h2>
        <p>
          At DEF company, my role involved enhancing an internal tool for
          automating the deployment process. By implementing new features and
          fixing bugs, I helped reduce the tool's execution time by 30%,
          significantly improving the development team's productivity.
